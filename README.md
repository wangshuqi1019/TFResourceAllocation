**Topology-free Epidemic Control through Resource Allocation Based on Historical Infection Information.** Zhen Wang, Shuqi Wang, Chijun Zhang, Mingda Xu, Qi Tan, Jianbo Wang, Petter Holme, Chao Gao, Zhanwei Du (2024). (in preparation).

We propose a data-driven topological-free resource allocation strategy based on individual historical infection information in electronic health records.  
* 'Data' consists of the model parameters, simulation networks, and prioritization of populations from multiple resource allocation strategies.
* 'EHR' generates the historical infection information from EHR.
* 'MainSimulations' contains the main simulation process. You can select a network and a reproduction number setting and run any main_XX.m to indicate simulating different resource allocation strategies.
