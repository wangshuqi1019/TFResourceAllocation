 We propose a data-driven topological-free resource allocation strategy based on individual historical infection information in electronic health records.  
* '1network' consists of the model parameters and simulation networks.
* '2beta' means how to calculate the transmission rate.
* '3EHR' generates the historical infection information from EHR.
* '4rank' contains the priority order given by different strategies.
* '5infection' is the main simulation process.
